   - Preprocesses the text (cleaning, normalization)
   - Generates a vector embedding using the all-mpnet-base-v2 model
   - Stores both the original text and the vector representation
   - The embedding process is automatic and transparent to the user

**Best Practices**:
- Store logically coherent chunks of information for better retrieval results
- Include relevant titles that summarize the document content
- For CSV or tabular data, consider storing each row or logical section as a separate document
- Update documents when information changes to ensure embeddings remain current","This content is about 'Key aspects of document storage:' within the section 'RAG System User Guide > RAG System User Guide > Core Functionality > Document Storage'. 1. **Document Structure**

"How Semantic Search Works:","RAG System User Guide<_dot_>RAG System User Guide<_dot_>Core Functionality<_dot_>Semantic Search<_dot_>How Semantic Search Works:","how-semantic-search-works","how-semantic-search-works","1. **Query Processing**
   - When you submit a search query, the system converts it into a vector embedding using the same model used for document storage
   - This query vector captures the semantic meaning of your question or search terms
   - The system then compares this vector against all document vectors in the database

2. **Similarity Calculation**
   - The system uses cosine similarity as the primary metric to compare vectors
   - Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, ranging from -1 (opposite meaning) to 1 (identical meaning)
   - Documents with higher similarity scores are more semantically related to your query

3. **Result Ranking**
   - Results are ranked by similarity score in descending order
   - The top_k parameter controls how many results are returned
   - Each result includes the document content and a similarity score

4. **Using Semantic Search**

   To search for documents:

   a. Using the API directly:

   b. Using Python with requests:

5. **Query Formulation Tips**
   - Be specific: Clearly articulate what you're looking for
   - Use natural language: The system understands conversational queries
   - Provide context: Include relevant details for more accurate results
   - Try variations: If you don't get desired results, try rephrasing your query

6. **Understanding Results**
   - Similarity scores above 0.8 generally indicate high relevance
   - Scores between 0.6-0.8 indicate moderate relevance
   - Scores below 0.6 may be tangentially related but less relevant
   - An empty result list means no documents matched well with your query

The semantic search capability allows you to find information based on conceptual understanding rather than exact keyword matches, making it powerful for retrieving relevant information even when the exact terminology differs.","This content is about 'How Semantic Search Works:' within the section 'RAG System User Guide > RAG System User Guide > Core Functionality > Semantic Search'. 1. **Query Processing**

   - Name: all-mpnet-base-v2
   - Vector Dimensions: 768
   - Model Type: Sentence Transformer
   - Training Data: Diverse text corpus including web content, books, and research papers
   - Optimization: Tuned for semantic similarity tasks

2. **Embedding Properties**
   - Each document is represented as a 768-dimensional floating-point vector
   - Vectors capture semantic meaning, context, and relationships between concepts
   - Similar concepts have vectors that are close in the vector space
   - The model is language-aware and understands English text well

3. **When Embeddings Are Generated**
   - Document embeddings: Generated at document storage time
   - Query embeddings: Generated when a query is processed
   - The same model is used for both document and query embedding to ensure compatibility

4. **Technical Details**
   - Embedding storage: Vectors are stored using pgvector's native ARRAY(FLOAT) type
   - Distance metric: Cosine similarity (1 - cosine distance) is used by default
   - Preprocessing: Text is normalized, tokenized, and processed through the model

5. **Embedding Limitations**
   - Context window: Limited to approximately 384 tokens (roughly 250-300 words)
   - Language support: Optimized for English, with varying performance on other languages
   - Domain specificity: General-purpose model that may not capture highly specialized terminology

6. **Advanced Usage**

   - Training Data: Diverse text corpus including web content, books, and research papers
   - Optimization: Tuned for semantic similarity tasks

2. **Embedding Properties**
   - Each document is represented as a 768-dimensional floating-point vector
   - Vectors capture semantic meaning, context, and relationships between concepts
   - Similar concepts have vectors that are close in the vector space
   - The model is language-aware and understands English text well

3. **When Embeddings Are Generated**
   - Document embeddings: Generated at document storage time
   - Query embeddings: Generated when a query is processed
   - The same model is used for both document and query embedding to ensure compatibility

4. **Technical Details**
   - Embedding storage: Vectors are stored using pgvector's native ARRAY(FLOAT) type
   - Distance metric: Cosine similarity (1 - cosine distance) is used by default
   - Preprocessing: Text is normalized, tokenized, and processed through the model

5. **Embedding Limitations**
   - Context window: Limited to approximately 384 tokens (roughly 250-300 words)
   - Language support: Optimized for English, with varying performance on other languages
   - Domain specificity: General-purpose model that may not capture highly specialized terminology

6. **Advanced Usage**

   If you're an advanced user integrating with the system:

> **Note**: The embedding model is integrated into the system and used automatically. Most users don't need to interact with it directly. This information is provided for those who want to understand the technical underpinnings of the semantic search capability."

   The pgvector extension must be installed in your PostgreSQL instance:

   This is handled automatically by the setup script.

2. **Vector Column**

   The system uses a dedicated column in the documents table to store vector data:

3. **Index Types**

   PGVector supports several index types for efficient similarity search:

   a. IVFFlat (default in the system):

   Good for general-purpose similarity search with moderate dataset size.

   b. HNSW (for better accuracy but slower indexing):

   Better search quality but slower index creation.

   c. Flat (for smaller datasets):

   Best for small datasets (under 10,000 documents).

4. **Distance Operators**

   PGVector provides three distance metrics:
   - `<->`: Cosine distance (default in the system)
   - `<=>`: Euclidean distance
   - `<#>`: Inner product

5. **Performance Tuning**

   For optimal performance:
   - Lists parameter: Set to √n/10 where n is the number of records
   - When using HNSW: Higher m and ef_construction values improve recall at the cost of build time and index size
   - Use LIMIT in queries to restrict the search space

6. **Example Query with PGVector**

   This is how the system performs vector similarity search internally:

   Where $1 is the query vector and $2 is the top_k parameter.
